Blacklist Alert allows you to create and maintain a personal blacklist of players. When you join a group or raid, the addon will automatically check if any members are on your blacklist. If a blacklisted player is found, the addon will display a visual warning on your screen and play a sound alert to ensure you are aware of their presence.

With a user-friendly interface, you can easily add or remove players from the blacklist using a simple command or the addon window.
